    "# Using A For Loop In A Function\n",
    "\n",
    "There really is nothing special about using a for loop in a function. That is, you can use any python code inside a function - so there is nothing unique about a for loop.  But, I want to cover this because you will need to use for loops in functions for the homework, and there is usually some confusion on this."

    "Let's code a function that takes in a list of words and also a number. It outputs a list of words, that only contains words from the input list that are the same length as the number we passed. The point of this function is just to practice what we have learned.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "For example, see the list `myWords` below, and the number, `myNumber`. If we wanted to make a list of words, from the `myWords` list, that only contained words with a length equal to 6, we would end up with `['orange', 'minute', 'second']` because those are the only words that are 6 characters long"
